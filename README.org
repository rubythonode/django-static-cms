#+TITLE: Django static CMS
#+AUTHOR: John Herrlin

Is a small and lightweigt CMS for Django.
The only dependencie is Django.

It could also be used together with Gunicorn if running in a
production environment.

As I write most of my documentation in Emacs Orgmode I can with ease
export the documents to good looking HTML files.
The idea came from [[https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa-CMS][Miserlou/Zappa-CMS]].
But as I dont write my documentation in Markdown i wanted something else.


* Run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python app.py runserver
#+END_SRC

* Add pages

Add new HTML pages inside the =pages/= directory and they will be show on the index page.
No migrations, no database, nothing!
